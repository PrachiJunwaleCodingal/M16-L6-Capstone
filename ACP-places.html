            Mahal in Agra, India. it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a
            17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which
            includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated
            wall.

            Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for
            another five
            years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the
            12th
            anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
            entirety in
            1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35
            billion (US$77.8
            million).</p>
