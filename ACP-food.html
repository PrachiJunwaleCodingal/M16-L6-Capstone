        The name chaat encompasses a wide variety of Indian street foods, snacks, or small meals which usually combine salty,
        spicy, sweet, and sour flavors. They are usually small, consumed on their own as a snack, or combined with other dishes
        to form a big meal.
        
        Throughout India, chaat can be found at chaatwallas – street vendors serving various dishes, from stuffed bread to
        deep-fried pastries with accompanying dipping sauces.

        Paratha is a flaky, layered, golden-brown Indian bread, which is typically consumed for breakfast. It consists of whole
        wheat flour that’s baked in ghee, Indian clarified butter, and comes in round, triangular, square, or hexagonal shapes.
        
        Very often, parathas are stuffed with ingredients such as boiled potatoes, cauliflower, garlic, ginger, chili, paneer,
        or radish. They are sometimes accompanied by pickles, yogurt, homemade chutneys, and occasionally served as a side to
        meat and vegetable curries. In Punjab, paratha is eaten with lassi, a popular yogurt-based drink.
