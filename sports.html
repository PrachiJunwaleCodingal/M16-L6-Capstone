        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is
        a
        22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced
        on three
        stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding
        bats,
        while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the
        opposite end of
        the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker,
        with
        the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges.

            Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which
            originated on
            either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. While these sports vary in
            specific rules,
            numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface, they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams
            using sticks to
            propel a ball or disk into a goal.

            There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled or bladed, while others do
            not. In
            order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word hockey is often preceded by another
            word, as in
            field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, rink hockey, or floor hockey.
